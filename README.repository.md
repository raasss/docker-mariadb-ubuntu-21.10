# Introduction

MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions. ([more info](https://mariadb.org/documentation/))

# Quickstart guide

Starting a mariadb instance with the latest version is simple via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose). If you don't have docker-compose tool installed, please go [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow instractions.

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `mariadb`:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

networks:
  private:
    driver: bridge

services:
  mariadb:
    image: raasss/mariadb-ubuntu-21.10:latest
    networks:
      - private
    ports:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_1=mysqld:key_buffer_size:16M
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:general_log:0
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:slow_query_log:1
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:long_query_time:2
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:log_slow_rate_limit:1
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:log_slow_verbosity:query_plan,explain,innodb
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:log_queries_not_using_indexes:1
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:log_slow_admin_statements:1
      - MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:character-set-server:utf8mb4
```

In your current working directory create `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run docker-compose and services should be up soon:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

We can find port where mariadb service listen for connections like this:

```console
$ docker-compose port mariadb 3306
0.0.0.0:49154
```

In this example we can configure any mariadb client with host `0.0.0.0:49154`.

# Advance guide

## Container shell access

The `docker-compose exec` command allows you to run commands inside a Docker container.

The following command line will give you a bash shell inside your `mariadb` container as root:

```console
$ docker-compose exec mariadb bash
```

## Access logs

The log is available through Docker's container log:

```console
$ docker-compose logs mariadb -f
```

You can omit `-f` if you don't want to tail logs in realtime.

## Customizing via environment variables

Customization of `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` file in docker image is implemented.

This file is standard configuration files in INI format. Every INI file is consisted of `<section>` and `<key> = <value>` pairs.

This is how trimmed version of `php.ini` file looks like:

```ini
[server]

# this is only for the mysqld standalone daemon
[mysqld]

#
# * Fine Tuning
#
key_buffer_size		= 16M
max_allowed_packet	= 16M

#
# * Query Cache Configuration
#
query_cache_limit	= 1M
query_cache_size        = 16M

#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# As of 5.1 you can enable the log at runtime!
general_log             = 0

#
# Error log - should be very few entries.
#
log_warnings = 4
#
# Enable the slow query log to see queries with especially long duration
slow_query_log = 1
long_query_time = 2
log_slow_rate_limit	= 1
log_slow_verbosity = query_plan,explain,innodb
log_queries_not_using_indexes = 1
log_slow_admin_statements = 1

#
# * Character sets
#
# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in Debian we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
#
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci

# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here
[mariadb]

# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.0 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-10.0]
```

Here we can see 3 sections: `server`, `mysqld` , `embedded` , `mariadb` and `mariadb-10.0`. And multiple `key=value` pairs:

- `key_buffer_size = 16M`
- `slow_query_log = 1`
- `character-set-server = utf8mb4`

To configure files above you need to add environment variables in format `MARIADB_SERVER_CONF_*`.

Value of these environment variables need to be in format `<section>:<key>:<value>` as can be found in example `docker-compose.yml` file above.

## Pull service images
```console
docker-compose pull
```

## Backup database inside docker to local filesystem
```console
docker-compose exec -u root mariadb mysqldump --add-drop-database --add-drop-table --single-transaction --verbose mydatabase > mydatabase.sql
```

## Restore database from local filesystem to docker
```console
cat mydatabase.sql | docker-compose exec -T -u root mariadb mysql mydatabase
```

## Start services
```console
docker-compose start
```

## List containers
```console
docker-compose ps
```

## Create and start containers
```console
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop services
```console
docker-compose stop
```

## Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
```console
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```
